    <h2>The absolute best lemonade</h2>
    <p>The lemonade will quickly quench your thirst on a hot day </p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar and water</li>
        <li>lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Juice you lemons</li>
        <p>Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer. <br> Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.</p>
        <li>Make simple Syrup</li>
        <p>It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.</p>
        <li>Stir</li>
        <p>Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. </p>
        <li>Serve</li>
        <p>Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candied lemon peel.</p>    
    </ol>
